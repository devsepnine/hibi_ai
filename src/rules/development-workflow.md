# Development Workflow

## Core Loop

**Define Problem** → **Small Safe Change** → **Review Change** → **Refactor** — Repeat.

## Problem 1-Pager

Before you start coding, if the problem is complex or unclear, draft a **Problem 1-Pager** including the following items. If any items are ambiguous, request an interview to clarify.

* **Background:** Context and motivation for the change.
* **Problem:** What specific issue are we trying to solve?
* **Goal:** What is the definition of success (the "success state")?
* **Non-goals:** What is explicitly out of scope?
* **Constraints:** Mandatory technical or business constraints.
