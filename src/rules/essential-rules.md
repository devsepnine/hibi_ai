# Essential Rules

1. **Read related files** before making any changes.
2. Keep tasks, commits, and PRs **small**.
3. Record **assumptions** in Issues, PRs, or ADRs.
4. **Validate all inputs** and encode/normalize all outputs.
5. Avoid **premature abstraction**; use names that reveal intent.
6. Compare at least **two alternatives** before making a decision.
